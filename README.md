# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



I developed a comprehensive booking application using React and Vite, designed to provide a seamless user experience across multiple pages. The app allows users to easily browse and book services or appointments through an intuitive interface. By implementing React Router, I ensured smooth navigation between dynamic web pages, making the app user-friendly.

React Router played a crucial role in enabling dynamic routing, which ensured that users could interact with different pages while maintaining a consistent experience.

Leveraging Vite as the build tool allowed for faster development and a more optimized app, offering quick load times and an enhanced user interface.

In terms of UI/UX, the app is designed with a clean, modern layout to make the booking process straightforward and visually appealing. Users can navigate through various options with ease, ensuring an enjoyable booking experience.
