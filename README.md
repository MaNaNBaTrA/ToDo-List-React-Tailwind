# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I know a to-do list is a common project, but what's new in mine is the combination of practical features and a visually appealing design. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the app not only lets users add tasks but also includes edit, delete, and mark-as-read options, offering a more flexible way to manage tasks.

A standout feature is the dynamic clock that updates every second, adding a real-time element to the interface. The appâ€™s beautiful, colorful design enhances the user experience, making it as visually pleasing as it is functional. Additionally, the app uses local storage to ensure that tasks are saved and retrieved even after refreshing, providing convenience and reliability.

This project goes beyond a basic to-do list by offering enhanced functionality and a smooth, interactive interface, making it more than just another task manager.
